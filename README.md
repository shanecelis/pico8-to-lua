# pico8-to-lua

This is a port of [Ben Wiley's
pico8-to-lua](https://github.com/benwiley4000/pico8-to-lua/) tool, which was
derived from a function in Jez Kabanov's
[PICOLOVE](https://github.com/picolove/picolove/) project.

PICOLOVE is licensed under the Zlib license and so was pico8-to-lua and so must

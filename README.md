# pico8-to-lua

A library and command line tool to convert Pico-8's dialect of Lua to plain Lua. 

## Origin

This is a port of [Ben Wiley's
pico8-to-lua](https://github.com/benwiley4000/pico8-to-lua/) Lua tool to Rust.
Pico8-to-lua was originally derived from a function in Jez Kabanov's
[PICOLOVE](https://github.com/picolove/picolove/) project.

## License 

PICOLOVE is licensed under the Zlib license and so is pico8-to-lua and so must
this project be.
